# decision tree GoJS
Goal is to come up with a new business name for my private dining service. Not Pany McPanface or other X McXface iterations

Workflow
- User sees multiple name choices.
- User clicks a name.
- Another set of name choices appears.
- User clicks a name from the set of choices.
- The final name is generated by combining two to three sets.

MVP
- Store user input in back end.
- Total number of selected names recorded and output as an integer.

ADVANCED GOALS
- NA. This is meant to be simple.

Commentary:
This could be putting too much naming power into the hands of random users, generating countless name combinations for my future business. Would this be more effectively accomplished by sending out a simple Google Form with two questions and a blank form for text entry?
